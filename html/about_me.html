                            Iâ€™m dedicated to personal and professional growth. My passion for programming and software
                            engineering stems from a commitment to continuous improvement. I strive to maintain a
                            positive outlook and adaptability in my work, aiming to uphold high standards in time

                            I welcome complex challenges as opportunities for learning. Achieving balance is crucial to
                            me; I know when to accelerate efforts to meet critical deadlines, and when to mull the
                            information over.
                            Honesty and transparency drive my professional interactions. My background in accounting
                            complements my keen interest in transitioning fully
                            into the IT field. Freelancing has enhanced my ability to learn and implement new skills
                            effectively.

                            I have a bsc. in International Industrial and Economic Engineering, which served as
                            the foundation and entry point. I went into the financial sector
                            and building sector, where I specialized in accounting,
                            administration, and some light weight project management. I wrote my graduate paper at
                            Tetra Pak focusing on operational analysis and worked there for a brief period of 2 years.

                            Following a personal health challenge in 2020, a brief but consequential battle with cancer,
                            I decided I wanted to transition into IT.
                            During the recovery I coded everyday. I decided to
                            redirect my career trajectory towards programming and data
                            science. In a sense, even during the most challenging parts, these recent four years have
                            been the happiest
                            experienced to this date.

                            My lifelong interest in technology and science found application during my data science
                            studies:
                            I developed and successfully deployed a neural network model that utilizes computer vision
                            to
                            predict autism during two years. This project, which incorporated several models, some from
                            Harvard, some from
                            the institution of Tesla. I read an extensive amount of
                            research from numerous academic papers and tried the most recent techniques for batching,
                            parameters, filters and pre-processing.
                            I worked on the project for two years and presented my work for a paper for my vocational
                            training in
                            AI and Data Science. The open source community for AI and data science is extensive and when
                            you acheive
                            good results you share your data. Even without having a masters degree a person with good
                            understanding
                            for Statistics and programming skills can add findings to the scientific community and
                            measure-up versus your co-collaborators.

                            After several interesting project went well, I was inspired to explore entrepreneurial
                            avenues.
                            I presented my two year work on the neural network model to some leading
                            investors in Copenhagen. My initiative led to a second-place finish in a highly competitive
                            AI funding event, underscoring the model's potential and innovative approach to
                            technological applications in healthcare. I look forward towards further collaboration and
                            hopefully, I get the chance to work with projects of a greater scale in the future

                            In the past, our access to information was largely limited to textbooks. Today, advancements
                            in data science have democratized access to information, enabling IT-talents to uncover
                            unique insights, some previously hidden. To summarize, I find it very exciting to work in
                            this
                            period of time, in this specific line of work.
                            It is a privilege to have this opportunity to contribute and be a positive influence in our
                            avanced information
                            society.
